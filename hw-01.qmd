# In this line graph, we see that over the years, both men and women have gotten faster, however it is clear that Men run faster times than women and that the lines never cross nor overlap. Additionally we see that in 2020, the marathon time was slower than the past 4 decades, likely due to the virtual events held due to the Covid-19 pandemic.
